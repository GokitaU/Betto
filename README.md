Betto is an application which allows to bet matches which have taken place already. The working principle is very simple. 
Some football data (leagues, teams, games etc.) is fetched from an external server and saved in application database.
Then application calculates rates for all collected fixtures. This is whole initial process, and after that players can
start bet simulations. To create bets you have to sign up, and then login. Firstly, you will need some money to bet. Open a user panel by clicking
on a floating button located in right top corner of the screen. A user menu is shown. Select payments from the menu and deposit some money.
After that we are ready to bet. A player may create a ticket by selecting specific games, from imported leagues. 
To create a ticket, firstly a player needs to select a league. After a while, a league info is shown on the screen.
A player may inspect league data (related season, number of matches played, teams details etc.). By selecting third tab, we can start adding
games to our ticket. Games may be filtered by a team, or a specific round, while searching. You can see game details, by clicking on a certain row
in game list view (team details information is also shown, by clicking the right team in the second tab). Choose your bet and add an event to our ticket.
You can add as many events as you want, but your total ticket rate can't exceed 5000 (total rate is a product of all rates from a ticket). You can see your 
ticket by clicking on a floating button, which is also located in right top corner of the screen. If you are ready, choose a correct stake and play a ticket.
After that, open a user panel once again, and select tickets. There you can see all tickets, you have created before. The result of the ticket is unknown yet.
To reveal it's result, click on an eye icon. Click on an eye once again to see, details of your ticket (you may notice which events were correct, which not etc.).
Then every user may compare results with other players, by opening a ranking from a user panel. There you can see, your balance and highest price.
